                    provision and manage infrastucture, PfSense as an open source router/firewall,

                    monitor
                    their usage, including Prometheus and Grafana which helps aggregate and visualize the data. While
                    Proxmox run it's own LXC containers, Docker runs
                    containers that primarily use docker. Nginx has a valid HTTPS certificate for
                    *.teddiursa.net, which allows for all hosts to have valid HTTPS encryption with no certificate

                    challenge itself is split into several steps:</p>

                <h2>The Website</h2>
                <p>While I'm no Web Designer, I have done some simple web development before, including a Javascript
                    visualization,
                    and I have always enjoyed how responsive web development is compared to traditional software
                    development.
                    I
                    started by finding a sample <a href="https://devsnap.me/html-resume-templates">template</a> online,
                    mostly for the dark mode colors, and heavily tweaking it. Funnily enough, I ended up using a
                    different
                    color
                    scheme, specifically Facebook's scheme I found on a <a
                        href="https://blog.karenying.com/posts/50-shades-of-dark-mode-gray">website</a> comparing
                    different
                    popular darkmode colors. What was most useful was the use of bootstrap grids, something I had not
                    used
                    before. I also spent a large amount of time ensuring the website would properly display for mobile
                    devices.
                    I also discovered that phones display websites differently unless you specifically indicate the
                    website
                    was
                    designed for mobile devices. I also learned about a useful "viewport" tag that enables you to get
                    the
                    width
                    of the user's screen, which helped scale my pictures.</p>

                <h2>Deploying on AWS</h2>
                <p>Creating a simple static website with an S3 bucket was relatively simple. I uploaded the relevant
                    files
                    and
                    enabled
                    it for static website hosting. After purchasing my domain name and configuring route 53 and
                    CloudFront
                    to
                    point my domain to my website, it still did not propagate after several hours. I discovered the
                    name
                    servers of my hosted zone and my registered domain did not match. Once I fixed this, my domain
                    resolved
                    properly and the previously requested HTTPS certificate instantly worked as well. Once I checked my
                    root
                    domain properly redirects and HTTPS was required, along with continually tweaking my website code,
                    it
                    was
                    time to implement some basic web functions.</p>

                <h2>Programming with AWS Lambda</h2>
                <p>One of the good things about this challenge is, while it gives you the basics for each step, it does
                    not
                    detail
                    how. For example, it simply links to a Javascript/Python tutorial not how to implement the specific
                    function. The
                    visitor counter logical was extremely simple, but I had to learn how to reference and update my
                    database.
                    Luckily, it is similar to how many programming languages handle inputs, plus some database syntax.
                    After
                    ensuring the proper permissions between the lambda function, the API gateway, and the database,
                    while
                    also
                    enabling CORS, I was able to successfully update and display my Visitor Counter.</p>

                <h2>An Additional Function</h2>
                <p>I wanted to add an additional feature with Lambda/AWS, since I wanted to stand out, but I had trouble
                    deciding on the function. I contemplated displaying different days of the week accessed, similar to
                    GitHub's
                    commit calendar, but ultimately decided something much simpler: time since the last visit. I
                    accomplished this
                    using <b>Unix time</b> which is a counter from the beginning of "time" for computers, which is
                    defined
                    as
                    1/1/1970.
                </p>
                <div class="unixTimeLine">
                    <h4>Current Unix Time</h4>
                    <h4><span id="unixTime" style="color:#20cef5">1711743756</span></h4>
                </div>
                <p>This <b>Unix time</b> is already in seconds (after truncating) and, since I'm not dealing with Time
                    Zones,
                    I
                    simply used this to find the difference since the last visit. I fiddled with Javascript to display
                    this
                    cleanly in a proper time format, ensuring it properly displayed any spaces and correct unit(s)</p>
                <h2>Automating with Terraform</h2>
                <p>I chose to use Terraform rather than SAM since it's a bit more flexible with other vendors. I started
                    the
                    process by deploying each service at a time, starting with the buckets. After declaring what types
                    my
                    uploaded files should be and setting an access policy, it went smoothly. Deploying CloudFront also
                    had
                    little issues, but properly getting my HTTPS certificate and DNS records was a bit trickier. I found
                    it
                    easier to do repeat steps manually to better visualize the steps needed for my IaC. After creating
                    the
                    records
                    needed for the DNS verification, I realized I had the same issue as before" my name servers did not
                    match. I changed them manually to verify this was the issue and then discovered they recently
                    added a
                    function to update my registered domain name servers. After automating this with Terraform's for
                    loop
                    equivalent, I was pleased to see it update in real time and for my certificate automatically
                    validated.</p>
                <h2>Passing API URLs from Terraform</h2>
                <p>An Issue I discovered from Terraform automation is the API gateway URLs changed every deployment,
                    which
                    would break the Javascript lambda calls unless they were manually changed each time. I decided to
                    resolve this in a
                    Cloud CI/CD way:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Have Terraform create a JSON file with the API gateway invoke URLs</li>
                    <li>Store the JSON file in an S3 bucket</li>
                    <li>Have the Javascript retrieve the JSON file and use the URLs to invoke the Lambda Function</li>
                </ul>
                I had the fetches happened synchronously, since they depended on the JSON fetch, which increased the
                load
                time. I also had the Lambda display not load until they were completed, instead display incrementing
                loading text.
                <h2>GitHub Actions</h2>
                <p>GitHub Actions executes a <i>workflow</i> when a specific event occurs. My workflow updates the files
                    of
                    the S3 bucket when I push changes to my repository. This way my website updates in real time
                    whenever I
                    make changes, instead of having to rerun my Terraform code.</p>
                <h2>Testing with pytest</h2>
                <p>I delayed creating unit tests for my Lambda code for a simple reason: there is no input for me to
                    test
                    for. Doing unit tests always reminds me of a certain QA joke:</p>
                <div class="joke">
                    <p>A QA tester walks into a bar and orders:</p>
                    <div class="jokelist">
                        <ul>
                            <li>a beer</li>
                            <li>2 beers</li>
                            <li>0 beers</li>
                            <li>99999 beers</li>
                            <li>-1 beers</li>
                            <li>adjkl beers</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <span style="color:#13cf13">Test Successful!</span>
                    <p>A customer walks into the bar and asks where the bathroom is</p>
                    <p>The bar goes up in <span style="color:#ff7e29">flames</span></p>
                </div>
                <p>A large reason for testing is to ensure that an unexpected input is handled properly and, as the joke
                    eloquently demonstrates, it's not as simple as it might seem.
                    However, my functions call upon values in a database, not directly from the user or code. So, while
                    I
                    can
                    test for basic functionality and proper output, the major purpose of testing for abnormal inputs is
                    unnecessary. But I did approach it thoroughly to ensure I can scale up my lambda functions and
                    their tests for future additions. After some research, I discovered a package that enables me to run
                    my
                    Lambda functions
                    locally, <i>lambda_local</i>. I also used moto to create mock AWS resources for my testing. While
                    it's
                    not necessary since my functions do not heavily manipulate the table data, I wanted to continue
                    the trend of learning new technologies when possible.
                    Since I was creating my mock tables during testing, I was able know exactly what the table data
                    was, whether a static value or the current Unix time, and test whether the output properly
                    incremented
                    the
                    count or correctly calculated the time difference.
                </p>
                <img src="testChart.svg" rel="prefetch" style="width:60%" alt="Time since last visit flowchart">
                <h2>Error Page</h2>
                <p>To replace the generic <a style="color:#cf1313">404</a> and <a style="color:#cf1313">403</a> error
                    pages,
                    I created a custom <a href="https://www.gregchow.net/error" style="color:#cf1313">error page</a>
                    complete with a Javascript function to display the current status of the website. The Javascript
                    calls on a Python Lambda Function to ensure compatibility, as client-side Javascript checks are
                    sometimes blocked. I contemplated having this error page be hosted in a separate S3 bucket, in case
                    I
                    had torn down the website using Terraform. However, Terraform would also destroy the CloudFront
                    distribution, which would cause the error page to be inaccessible anyways.
                </p>
                <h2>Automating Cache Invalidation</h2>
                <p>CloudFront caches the website files at Edge Locations to reduce latency and load. While this is
                    great,
                    since it prevents users from accessing the S3 bucket website directly, it does need to be told
                    when I update the S3 files. While I could do this manually via the AWS GUI, I utilized what I
                    learned to
                    automate this process.
                    First I simply found the AWS CLI commands to do and test this. While I could have just make a simple
                    script and invoked it using GitHub actions, I decided to do this via
                    a Lambda Function. I implemented a Python function to list my CloudFront distributions and invoke a
                    call
                    to invalidate all files in the wild card path <b>/*</b>. After testing, I then:
                </p>
                <div class="list">
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Created an API gateway linking to the clearCache Lambda Function.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Added the API URL to my JSON File/URL bucket, to ensure it works between Terraform
                            deployments.

                            Used GitHub actions to parse through the JSON file and do a simple HTTP GET request to the
                            API
                            URL,
                            clearing my cache on every git push.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>I also made sure to check I wouldn't accidentally go out of the AWS free tier. But as long as I don't
                    push
                    to my Repository more than 10,000 times a month, it will stay free.</p>
