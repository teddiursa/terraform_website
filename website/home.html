There are a mix of dashboards and Nginx Proxy Manager to help organize the hosted services and easily manage them via a web UI, including remotely running scripts. VMware's ESXI vSphere hypervisor is virtualized due to not supporting my network card and hosts commonly used Virtual Machines to help teach differences between Proxmox and VMware.

                I
                started by by finding a sample <a href="https://devsnap.me/html-resume-templates">template</a> online,
                mostly for the dark mode colors, and heavily tweaking it. Funnily enough, I ended up using a different
                color
                scheme, specifically facebook's scheme I found in a <a href="https://blog.karenying.com/posts/50-shades-of-dark-mode-gray">website</a> comparing different
                popular darkmode colors. What was most useful was the use of bootstrap grids, something I had not used
                before. I also spent a large amount of time ensuring the website would properly display for mobile
                devices.
                I also discovered that phones display websites differently unless you specifically indicate the website
                was
                designed for mobile devices. I also learned about a useful "viewport" tag that enables you to get the
                width
                of the user's screen, which helped scale my pictures.</p>

            <h2>Deploying on AWS</h2>
            <p>Creating a simple static website with an S3 bucket was easy. I simply uploaded the relevant files and
                enabled
                it for static website hosting. After purchasing my domain name and configuring route 53 and cloudfront
                to
                point my domain name to my website, it still did not propragate after several hours. I discovered the
                name
                servers of my hosted zone and my registered domain did not match. Once I fixed this, my domain resolved
                properly and the previously requested HTTPS certificate instantly worked as well. Once I checked my root
                domain properly redirects and HTTPS was required, along with continually tweaking my website code, it
                was
                time to implement some basic web functions.</p>

            <h2>Programming with AWS Lambda</h2>
            <p>One of the good things about this challenge, while it gives you the basics for each steps, it does not
                detail
                how to do it. For example, it simply links to a javescript/python tutorial not how to implement it. The
                visitor counter logical was extremely simple, but I had to learn how to reference and update my
                database.
                Luckily, it is similar to many programming languages handle inputs, plus some database syntax. After
                ensuring the proper permissions between the lambda function, the API gateway, and the database, while
                also
                enabling CORS, I was able to successfully update and display my Visitor Counter.</p>

            <h2>An Additional Function</h2>
            <p>I wanted to add an additional feature with lambda/aws, since I wanted to stand out, but I had trouble
                deciding on the function. I contemplated displaying different days of the week accessed, similar to
                github's
                calendar, but ultimately decided something much simpler: time since the last visit. I accomplished this
                using <b>unix time</b> which is a counter from the beginning of "time" for computers, which is defined
                as
                1/1/1970.
            </p>
            <div class="unixTimeLine">
                <h4>Current Unix Time</h4>
                <h4><span id="unixTime" style="color:#20cef5">1700501528</span></h4>
            </div>
            <p>This <b>unix time</b> is already in seconds (after truncating) and since I'm not dealing with timezones,
                I
                simply used this time to find the difference since last visit. I fiddled with javascript to display this
                cleanly in a weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds format, ensuring it properly displayed any spaces
                and
                singular/plural units.</p>

            <h2>Automating with Terraform</h2>
            <p>I chose to use Terraform rather than SAM since it's a bit more flexible with other vendors. I started the
                process by deploying each service at a time, starting with the buckets. After declaring what types my
                uploaded files should be and setting an access policy, it went smoothly. Deploying cloudfront also had
                little issues, but properly getting my HTTPS certificate and dns records had more issues. I found it
                easier
                to do some steps manually to better visualize the steps needed for my IAC. After creating the records
                needing for the DNS verification, I realized I had the same issue as before, my name servers did not
                match.
                I changed them manually to verify this was the issue and discovered they recently (6 months ago) added a
                function to update my registered domain name server's. After automating this with terraforms for loop
                equivalent, I was pleased to see it update in real time and for my certificate to be automatically
                validated. After splitting my functions into several files for easier future tweaking, it was time to
                automate the functions</p>
            <h2>Github Actions</h2>
            <p>Github Actions executes a <i>workflow</i> when a specific events occurs. My workflow updates the files of
                the S3 bucket when I push changes to my repository. This way my website updates in real time whenever I
                make changes, instead of having to rerun my terraform code. </p>
